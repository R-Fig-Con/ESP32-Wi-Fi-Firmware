# Wi-Fi firmware for ESP32
## A Low-Cost Experimental Platform for Dense Wireless Networks

This repository contains the firmware for a wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol implementation, developed for an ESP32 microcontroller development board (DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1) paired with a CC1101 radio module.

Key components include:

- MAC protocol implementation based on CSMA/CA, with RTS/CTS and NAV.

- Traffic generator for producing periodic network traffic.

- Terminal application for remote configuration and monitoring of the ESP32 nodes.
